Approach for prediction of Credit Card Lead

Analysis of Data:

1.Observed the features and their importance in prediction of Credit Card Lead(EDA) using barplots, heatmap, correlation values, violin plots etc.

Data Pre-Processing:

1.Given Dataset is an imbalaced dataset
2.There are missing values in feature 'Credit_Product' which is one of the required feature for prediction. 
3.Imputed the missing values with new category and balanced the dataset.
4.Convert the categorical columns to numerical columns.
5.Scaled the numerical columns data.

Models:

1.Here we have to apply classfication algorithms(Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVC, Decision Tree, Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost Classifier) for prediction.
2.Fine Tune the above models for best prediction.
3.In the python code , there is implementation of Random Forest Classifier with fine tuned parameters which are retrieved using RandomizedSearchCV.
4.Keep the parameters of Random Forest Classifier such that the model does not overfit on the training data.
5.The results have been saved to CSV file.
